          <p>
            India follows a hybrid legal system with elements from common law, civil law, customary law, and religious law. 
            The Constitution of India, adopted on January 26, 1950, serves as the foundational document of Indian law, 
            establishing a federal structure with division of powers between the Union and State governments.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Indian legal system is structured with the Supreme Court at the apex, followed by High Courts at the state level,
            and District Courts at the district level. Specialized tribunals handle specific areas of law to ensure efficient 
            resolution of disputes.
